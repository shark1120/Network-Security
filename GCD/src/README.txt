Implement the GCD algorithm using any programming language you like

SOLUTION:

I used java to implement the GCD algorithm. In order to implement the algorithm, I used the recursive method that was mentioned in the wikipedia page for the Euclidean algorithm cited in the assignment page on blackboard.

I have included the Solution.java file with the assignment. I successfully compiled the program in my terminal using the following commands:
	- cd src
	- javac Solution.java
	- java Solution
